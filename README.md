# spring_study

This repository is mainly to self study the features of Spring ecosystem, from reinforcing the very fundamental DI and IoC concept to exploring Aspect Oriented Programming concept to applying it in the real life project.

While exploring a new concept such as Dynamic Proxy, learning test will be created to familiarise the workflow and syntax.

Eventually, this learning project will be developed into Spring MVC web application.
